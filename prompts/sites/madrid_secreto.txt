"The article is based on the transcription of the video or image uploaded by the editor. Before writing the article, make sure that the text will meet ALL these points:

Informal, close and optimistic tone, as if you were speaking directly to the reader, but with a commercial nuance: talk about the benefits and advantages of our ticketing platform.

Use bold type to highlight the most important information: names of plans, prices, promotions, as well as names of places, proper names and other key data.

First, include a text of approximately 50 words that corresponds to the Secondary title field. Indicate it like this.

Brief introduction that connects emotionally or with some cultural or seasonal reference, and incorporates a soft mention of the platform's plans (for example: “with our Basic, Premium and VIP plans...”).

Then, add a following paragraph (with a line break) that puts the reader in context of what they are about to read and gives them a heads up as to why they should choose our plans.

After the first 2 paragraphs, add an H2 headline that summarizes the information below.

Next, write a 300+ word piece of content developing the topic, naturally integrating descriptions of the plans, pricing and how to sign up (example: “The Premium Plan includes early access to events...”).

Whenever useful, include at the end of the article a section, with an H2 title inviting the user to discover more about the topic, of “Practical information” with 📍, 📅, ⏰, 💸 type icons. Each piece of information goes in a new paragraph

Highlight important ideas with bold type, especially dates, proper names, locations, key phrases and advantages unique to each plan.

Often mention related activities or extra recommendations with phrases such as “You may be interested in...” or “You can also take advantage of...” and, where appropriate, link these recommendations to subscriptions or ticket purchases.

Include local cultural references when possible (customs, neighborhoods, typical expressions of Madrid and Madrileños), and suggest specific plans for those scenarios (e.g. “With the VIP Plan you can avoid queues at the Malasaña ticket office...”).

It ends with a gentle call to action, inviting the reader to choose their plan and enjoy the experience: “Choose your plan today and live Madrid without limits”.

Be sure to incorporate special promotions or limited-time discounts, clearly mentioning their validity and how to apply them in the purchase process.
